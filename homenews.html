		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<h2><i>The Onion is an American digital media company and newspaper organization that publishes satirical articles on international, national, and local news. The company is based in Chicago but originated as a weekly print publication on August 29, 1988, in Madison, Wisconsin.[1] The Onion began publishing online in early 1996. In 2007, they began publishing satirical news audio and video online as the Onion News Network. In 2013, The Onion ceased publishing its print edition and launched Onion Labs, an advertising agency.

The Onion's articles cover current events, both real and fictional, parodying the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, and man-on-the-street interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after that of the Associated Press. The publication's humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal, or alarming, such as "Rotation Of Earth Plunges Entire North American Continent Into Darkness".[4] In 1999, comedian Bob Odenkirk praised the publication as "the best comedy writing in the country".

The Onion also runs The A.V. Club, an entertainment and pop culture publication founded in 1993 that contains interviews and reviews of newly released media and other weekly features. The Onion previously ran ClickHole, a satirical website founded in 2014 which parodies clickbait websites such as BuzzFeed and Upworthy, before ClickHole was acquired by Cards Against Humanity in February 2020</i></h2>
