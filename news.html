	<p><i>MIAMI—According to sources familiar with the case, new charges filed Thursday in the federal indictment against Donald Trump suggested that the former president instructed a Mar-a-Lago employee to tape over security footage with a rerun of Hong Kong Phooey. “Despite being more than aware that doing so would obstruct an ongoing federal investigation, Trump ordered property manager Carlos De Oliveira to erase Mar-A-Lago security footage and replace it with the antics of the crime-fighting dog Penrod ‘Penry’ Pooch,” said sources, who confirmed that all surveillance footage pertaining to the classified documents case had been replaced by episodes of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon. “This was crucial evidence, and now all investigators have is episode six, where Phooey saves a candy factory and foils Professor Presto’s malevolent plan. He can argue it’s his favorite show and he’s allowed to tape it any way he likes, but we’ll just have to see how that holds up in court.” At press time, sources confirmed that the Justice Department was also investigating Trump for holding onto classified episodes of Hong Kong Phooey that were never supposed to leave the White House.</i></p>

		<p><i>For someone who has spent as long as 14 minutes lying on the pitch at FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia, Brazilian striker Neymar has been at the centre of many jokes and online memes that have amused the fans.

Brazil's forward Neymar on the ground during FIFA World Cup 2018 round of 16 against Mexico at the Samara Arena.

Neymar’s antics of crying in agony on slightest of touches and even flopping on the ground several rounds has not only been a source of entertainment for fans, but has also attracted criticism.

Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osario said, after his team’s 0-2 defeat to Brazil in the round of 16 match: “We wasted a lot of time because of one single player. I think this is a real shame for football, especially for kids who are watching because this has to be a sport of virility, of determination, a man’s sport, like other games, and not a charade.”

Neymar had fallen on the ground claiming that Mexican Miguel Layun had stepped on his ankle.</i></p>

<p><i>According to Science Magazine, there’s a repeating apocalyptic problem every 100,000 years — supervolcanoes. These volcanoes start with collapsing underground calderas that produce eruptions of more than 450 cubic kilometers of magma. For reference, the Mount St. Helens explosion in 1980 released just 0.25 cubic kilometers of magma. Worst-case scenario? In addition to large-scale destruction near ground zero, the ash lifted into the atmosphere blocks the sun and drops global temperatures by five to ten degrees Celsius for a decade, while ash on the ground kills all plant life.

Potential prevention here stems from solid knowledge, which means more time and money for scientists trying to understand and model volcanic behavior. While it may be impossible to eliminate the chance of a supervolcano explosion, good data could help minimize the impact.

Prepping for the end of the world? Signs of the apocalypse include angry robots, new infections and supervolcanoes. Oh, and don’t be fooled by the bright, friendly sun — it’s coming for us all, eventually.</i></p>
